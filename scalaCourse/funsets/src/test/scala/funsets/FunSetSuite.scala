   * Instead of copy-pasting the code for creating the set into every test, we can
   * store it in the test class using a val:

   * the test methods are not even executed, because creating an instance of the
   * test class fails!

   * Therefore, we put the shared values into a separate trait (traits are like
   * abstract classes), and create an instance inside each test method.
